==This is personal use radial menu, based on "VOX" by c2 and "Admin System Radial Menus" by Davide7097==
You will need "Admin System" and "Admin Menu 2.0" in order for some radial command to function properly

Mk2: I've added Left 4 Bots support, in "Panic" radial menu (Limited). You will need Left 4 Bots (and its associated item)!
Commands for keybinding, you can execute them one by one or autoexec.cfg (if you don't have one, make a new one with exact name)
bind "b" "+mouse_menu ASRMb"
bind "c" "+mouse_menu Warning"
bind "g" "+mouse_menu QA"
bind "v" "+mouse_menu Panic"
bind "z" "+mouse_menu Orders"
